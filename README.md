# WordGame

## How much time was invested
8 hours

## How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
- concept         ->  30 minutes
- model layer     ->  20 minutes
- view            ->  30 minutes
- architecture    -> 220 minutes
- game mechanics  -> 120 minutes
- tests           ->  60 minutes

## Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game

I used The Composable Architecture to solve problems such as state management, side effects, testing and data flow

## Decisions made because of restricted time

- simple layout
- few tests

## What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time

- Custom confirmation dialog
- Error handling
- Test coverage
- Animation
- File structure (Mini Modules)
